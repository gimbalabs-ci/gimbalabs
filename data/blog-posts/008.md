# Here’s a recap of what took place during our last Gimbalabs Open Spaces.

---

## Introduction

[Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) is a community-driven initiative to fund innovative projects within the Cardano ecosystem. The discussions revolve around proposal submissions, community engagement, and project development.

---

## Key Concepts

- Proposal Submission: Participants can submit proposals for funding, with deadlines and guidelines communicated through various channels.

- Community Engagement: Engaging with community members to gather feedback and support for proposals is crucial. Following active contributors can help track their submissions.

---

## Proposal Development Process

- Idea Generation: Proposals often stem from personal motivations and community needs. Participants are encouraged to brainstorm and refine their ideas collaboratively.

- Utilizing Notion for Tracking: Notion is used to document proposals and track their progress. Participants can create databases to manage their submissions and related activities.

---

## Challenges and Strategies

- Incomplete Proposals: It’s common for proposals to be in draft form, allowing for iterative improvements based on community feedback.

- Adapting to Feedback: Participants should be open to adjusting their proposals based on reviews and community input, focusing on the alignment of their goals with community needs.

---

## Tools and Resources

- Using APIs and Data: There are discussions about utilizing APIs to extract data from Project Catalyst for better analysis and tracking of proposals.

- Lido Nation: A platform that provides tools for managing proposals and community interactions, enhancing the proposal process.

---

## Conclusion

The success of Project Catalyst relies on active participation, collaboration, and adaptability within the community. Participants are encouraged to focus on their passions while leveraging the Catalyst framework to enhance their proposals and community impact.

## Key Concepts in Cardano Governance and Development

- Evolution of Governance

The Cardano governance system has undergone significant changes, with a focus on bringing governance live on-chain. This evolution is expected to continue, with potential changes in the next six months.

The introduction of the Cardano Constitution and a structured budget aims to address past complaints and issues related to funding and project sustainability.

- Challenges in Project Funding

Many projects experience delays in funding, leading to frustration among developers. This is likened to social interactions where initial enthusiasm fades over time .

The importance of sharing experiences and learning from failures is emphasized, as these are crucial for growth and adaptation in the evolving landscape of Cardano governance.

- Importance of Experimentation

The Cardano project is described as an unprecedented experiment at a large scale. Acknowledging failures and learning from them is essential for future success.

Successful proposals often stem from identifying small, manageable pieces of work that connect to larger goals.

- Collaboration and Networking

Building connections and partnerships among projects increases the likelihood of funding and successful outcomes. Collaborative efforts are encouraged to address common pain points .

The concept of “loosely joined” networks is highlighted, where small projects can come together to form larger, more impactful initiatives.

- Technical Challenges and Maintenance

Technical issues, such as compatibility with new versions of software, pose challenges for ongoing project development. The need for maintenance and adaptability in coding practices is emphasized .

The discussion around the future of programming languages and tools in the Cardano ecosystem reflects the uncertainty and rapid evolution of technology.

- The Role of AI in Development

AI’s potential to assist in coding and project management is acknowledged, but concerns about reliability and trustworthiness are raised. The importance of critical evaluation of AI outputs is emphasized.

The idea of using AI as a tool for enhancing productivity and providing insights into coding practices is explored, suggesting a future where AI can support developers effectively.

- Grassroots Movements and Resilience

The shift from top-down systems to grassroots movements in project development is noted. This approach allows for more resilient systems that can adapt to changes in technology and governance.

The focus on small, incremental steps in building systems reflects a practical approach to navigating the complexities of governance and development in Cardano.
