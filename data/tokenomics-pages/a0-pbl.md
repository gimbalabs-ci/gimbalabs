## Current Milestones:
1. Deliver the next version of the Plutus PBL Course by July 18.
2. Catalyst Fund 9 proposals are due by June 30. What opportunities to we have to write proposals from "Contribution Nodes"?

## Current Next Steps - Focus on Action:
1. For the next 4 weeks, we will use our Working Group time (Tuesdays at 1930utc) to focus on the Plutus PBL Course. Everyone in this working group is welcome to contribute to the Plutus PBL Course (see below).
2. And, contribution to PPBL is not required. If you're working on Catalyst Proposals or exploring questions of education and governance, keep it up! After the Fund 9 proposal deadline and the PPBL Course Launch, we'll zoom out from our focused time to further develop the DAOrg Chart, PBL Framework, and look ahead to Tokenomics PBL and Allocation 1.

## How to Contribute to PPBL Course:
1. Review Content: Everyone is welcome to review [Plutus PBL, Version 1.0](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/courses/15) and the ["Mini-Course" on Gimbal Bounty Treasury + Escrow](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/courses/16). Thank you to Melanie, Sebastian, Stephen W., and Hinson for providing feedback already!
2. Keep learning: Before we can write great educational content, there is plenty we still have to learn. If you're learning about the Cardano-Serialization Libraries, testing upcoming changes with the Vasil hard fork, diving deep into Smart Contract Design Patterns, or thinking about how to teach Haskell, you're preparing to contribute.
3. Build Specialization and Contribution Modules. If you want to practice building a Module about any topic, go for it!
4. Write documentation for [Gimbal Bounty Treasury and Escrow](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/gimbal-bounty-treasury-and-escrow).
5. We will discuss these + additional next steps when we meet on 21 June. If you need immediate help or access to contribute in any of the ways listed above, please ping this working group on Discord (#a0-project-based-learning).

### Keep Learning Canvas
- Continue to complete the "Growing With Canvas" Course at [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com). See the note below about Learning Canvas + Current Bounty.

## Next Meeting (2022-06-21 at 1930 UTC)
- This Working Group meets every Tuesday at 1930 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)

### Learning Canvas + Current Bounty (Updated 2022-05-17)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- One of the Growing with Canvas course assignments is to create a "Sandbox Course". Once you have access to [gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com), you can create a Sandbox Course.
- In order to commit to the Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Cardano mainnet via Nami.

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Project Based Learning
- Promote GMBL for payment of project dev	Take the raw material of TPBL A0 and PPBL Course #1 and begin to write cohesive PBL Curriculum. Create systems so that other Groups can make rec's for Projects + Case Studies
- Will help when I can.	Create a cleaned-up and tighter curriculum for how to launch a new token.	Find out how to best structure accquried knowledge & materials to create new iterrations of our previous PBL courses.
- Create a revenue-generating product from PPBL
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build learning material
- "Report how long A0 Project took and what was achieved.
- Report should be reusable in A1"
