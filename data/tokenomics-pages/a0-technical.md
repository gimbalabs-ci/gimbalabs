## What we are doing
Supporting other tokenomics teams

### Current Steps
- Building and documenting [Gimbal Bounty Treasury + Escrow](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/gimbal-bounty-treasury-and-escrow)

### Next Steps
- Deploy Gimbal Bounty Treasury + Escrow for this Working Group, and use it to list additional tasks.

### How to get involved
- Plutus PBL meets for Live Coding every Wednesday and Thursday (and right now, most Mondays and Tuesdays). Join us in Gimbalabs Discord.

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Technical
- Write a Development Agenda consisting of tooling that will directly support the outcomes of other Groups in TPBL and facilitate scaling in A1 - A7. Consider starting with urgent tasks like distributing keys to the Gimbal treasury and initializing tools to help track/audit/visualize movement of gimbals. Then set priorities and choose a development framework to practice using.
- How do we create an offchain placeholder token (to be used within the C4C circle economy) "pegged" to a gimbal that can be traded for gimbals if the holder so desires. How can we simulate transactions for members who are unfamiliar with crypto?
- Be a resource for other groups in TPBL and the greater community to solve or implement technical requests	Collect information about "What people want to do?" inside this group.
- Create two revenue-generating products
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build tools
- 1. Build the infrastructure
- 2. work with the groups to build tech that serve the purpose/needs (tuff task with multiple potential needs & ideas)
