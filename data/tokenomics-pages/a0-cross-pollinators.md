## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Connectors, Cross Pollinators, Network Builders, Recruiters
- Produce a set of recommendations for how to provide maximum clarity to various stakeholdrs about what's happening with Gimbal Token
- help set priorities for Allocation #1
- Thanks for doing this for the "invisibles." Looking forward to seeing what you come up with. This is a challenge that has stumped me.
- How do we reward those invisible and unseen activities of connectors, cross-pollinators, network builders, and recruiters? How do we incentivize and recognize this kind of work?
- have interesting experiments to share with the group
- Central support but also for the various groups/use cases
