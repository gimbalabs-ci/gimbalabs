## What we are doing
- Planning Iteration #2 of Plutus PBL by debriefing Iteration #1 and moving toward a modular, self-paced, project-based model.
- Onboarding to Canvas LMS
- Planning the role that Tokenomics PBL will play in Gimbal Allocation 1, by collecting best ideas/processes/outcomes from Allocation 0 and drafting a modular TPBL Curriculum.

### Current Steps 2022-05-11
- Learning Canvas (see below)
- Curriculum Development: next meeting, with optional preparation below
- See Miro Board: "How do you want to contribute to this Working Group?"

### Next Meeting (2022-05-17 at 1830 UTC)
- This Working Group meets every Tuesday at 1830 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)
- Optional Preparation: On the Miro board linked above, look for the links to "Raw Material" in PPBL and TPBL. We will reference these materials at our next meeting on 17 May, as we start to draft a list of Outcomes and Project Modules for Plutus PBL and Tokenomics PBL. If you need access to one of the Gimbalabs Canvas courses, please contact James.

### Learning Canvas + Current Bounty (Updated 2022-05-11)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- One of the Growing with Canvas course assignments is to create a "Sandbox Course". Once you have access to [gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com), you can create a Sandbox Course.
- In order to commit to the Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Cardano mainnet via Nami.

### NOTE: Different Canvas Instances:
- [https://canvas.instructure.com](https://canvas.instructure.com): this is where we originally tested Plutus PBL and Tokenomics PBL. These course materials will be imported into gimbalabs.instructure.com
- [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com): the official Gimbalabs Canvas account. Make sure you can access this one and that you have access to "Growing with Canvas" and that you can create your own "Sandbox Course"
- [https://implementations.instructure.com](https://implementations.instructure.com): OPTIONAL, for anyone who wants to dive deeper into Canvas Administration. There is a weekly meeting with the Canvas Team on Wednesdays at 1830 UTC. Reach out to James on Discord if you are interested in participating.
