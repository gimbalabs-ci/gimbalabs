## What we are doing

### Current Steps
- Each group can list current projects here

### Next Steps
- Upcoming work
- Help wanted / bounties

## How to get involved
- You can share links to resources
- Or meeting times

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Tokenomics, Treasury, Liquidity
- How do we create an offchain placeholder token (to be used within the C4C circle economy) "pegged" to a gimbal that can be traded for gimbals if the holder so desires. How can we simulate transactions for members who are unfamiliar with crypto?
- Create a white paper of the tokenomics model of Gimbals once we get a few allocations behind us	Track Gimbal spendings of each group, discover which one turned out needing more/less than expected.
- Establish a working treasury and cashflow; build value and liquidity for gimbal
- have interesting experiments to share with the group
- I would like to see visual representations of treasuries and a rulebook about Gimbal tokens	How it could apply in general but also get involved in the various use cases
