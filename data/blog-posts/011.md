Gimbalabs, in partnership with [SIDAN Lab](https://x.com/sidan_lab), is redefining blockchain education with **weekly learning sessions every Tuesday at 14:30 UTC**. These sessions are designed to make production-level, scalable learning accessible to everyone, **particularly developers new to Cardano**, who are eager to integrate their tech stacks with this cutting-edge blockchain ecosystem.

*Why Join These Sessions?*
The sessions aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical application, focusing on real-world development scenarios using [Aiken](https://x.com/aiken_eng), Cardano’s lightweight and expressive smart contract language.

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just beginning your journey in blockchain development, these sessions provide:

- **Hands-On Learning**: Dive into real-world examples of smart contract creation and blockchain integration.
- **Scalable Skills**: Learn techniques to build solutions that scale and meet production-level demands.
- **Community Collaboration**: Work alongside peers and mentors, fostering a vibrant and supportive learning environment.

*The Aiken PBL Course on Andamio*
To enhance the learning experience, these sessions are supported by a detailed course available on the [Andamio platform](https://x.com/AndamioPlatform). This course uses **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** to immerse participants in practical, hands-on projects that mirror the challenges of building on Cardano.
