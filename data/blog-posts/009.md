At Gimbalabs, we are re truly honored to be nominated for the **[Cardano Summit 2024 awards](https://voting.summit.cardano.org)** in the **Educational Influencer** category. To stand alongside so many other amazing Cardano contributors feels surreal, and we are deeply grateful to be considered.

We have always believed that education is the key to unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology. But it is not something we could do alone—this recognition is a testament to everyone who is been part of this journey with us. Whether you have joined a Gimbalabs project, contributed to an idea, or even just shared a moment of curiosity, you have been part of what keeps us going.

To the Cardano community and everyone who works tirelessly to push this space forward, thank you. And to all the other nominees, congratulations—we are inspired by what you are doing, and we are proud to be in such great company.

Here is to continuing the work we love and to the future we are building together.

**Gratefully,**

**James Dunseith and the Gimbalabs Team.**
