## What we are doing
- Planning Iteration #2 of Plutus PBL by debriefing Iteration #1 and moving toward a modular, self-paced, project-based model.
- Onboarding to Canvas LMS
- Planning the role that Tokenomics PBL will play in Gimbal Allocation 1, by collecting best ideas/processes/outcomes from Allocation 0 and drafting a modular TPBL Curriculum.
- Exploring the role that a PBL Framework might play in building a Distributed Autonomous Org Chart

## Current Steps 2022-05-24
### What do you want to work on? Is there work you want to lead?
- Please complete this task before 31 May.
- Review the [A0 PBL Working Group Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO4u0254=/?share_link_id=953117716780).
- Near the bottom of the Miro board, look for the purple sticky note that says "Where + how do you most want to build + test this PBL Framework?".
- Add your own purple sticky note somewhere on the chart. Look at others for examples. If you want to contribute to making BBK Modules for the PPBL Course, place a sticky there with your name and a description of your interest. If you want to contribute to building the TPBL course, place a sticky there, etc.
- More information in [Meeting recording 2022-05-24](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ac9KQsdozelIaVmOjHbU33A21xAFgVvq/view?usp=sharing)

### Learning Canvas
- Continue to complete the "Growing With Canvas" Course at [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com). See the note below about Learning Canvas + Current Bounty.

### Writing PBL Course Content
- We are currently drafting desired outcomes for Plutus and Tokenomics PBL. On the Miro board linked above, look for the links to "Raw Material" in PPBL and TPBL. How can these materials help us to define outcomes for the next iteration of each course?

## Next Meeting (2022-05-31 at 1930 UTC)
- This Working Group meets every Tuesday at 1930 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)

### Learning Canvas + Current Bounty (Updated 2022-05-17)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- One of the Growing with Canvas course assignments is to create a "Sandbox Course". Once you have access to [gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com), you can create a Sandbox Course.
- In order to commit to the Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Cardano mainnet via Nami.

### NOTE: Different Canvas Instances:
1. Most important: [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com): the official Gimbalabs Canvas account. Make sure you can access this one and that you have access to "Growing with Canvas" and that you can create your own "Sandbox Course"
2. First iterations: [https://canvas.instructure.com](https://canvas.instructure.com): this is where we originally tested Plutus PBL and Tokenomics PBL. These course materials will be imported into gimbalabs.instructure.com
3. Optional (only for initial implementation): [https://implementations.instructure.com](https://implementations.instructure.com): For anyone who wants to dive deeper into Canvas Administration. There is a weekly meeting with the Canvas Team on Wednesdays at 1830 UTC. Reach out to James on Discord if you are interested in participating.

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Project Based Learning
- Promote GMBL for payment of project dev	Take the raw material of TPBL A0 and PPBL Course #1 and begin to write cohesive PBL Curriculum. Create systems so that other Groups can make rec's for Projects + Case Studies
- Will help when I can.	Create a cleaned-up and tighter curriculum for how to launch a new token.	Find out how to best structure accquried knowledge & materials to create new iterrations of our previous PBL courses.
- Create a revenue-generating product from PPBL
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build learning material
- "Report how long A0 Project took and what was achieved.
- Report should be reusable in A1"
