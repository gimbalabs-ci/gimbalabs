## Making the World Work Better For All People, Animals and the Planet

- Forming a process to communicate ideas and reach decisions based on member concensus over centralized/leadership
- Reaching a collective C4C GTPBL "Why/Purpose/Value" before moving into "How & What"

### Next Steps
- Exploring sub-experiments
- Creating appropriate timelines & expectations both from within the group experiment & GTPBL
- Communicating & including C4C Community both to the experiment as participants and as co-creators
