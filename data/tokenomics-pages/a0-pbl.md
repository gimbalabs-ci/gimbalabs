## Next Meeting (2022-07-19 at 1930 UTC)
- This Working Group meets every Tuesday at 1930 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)

## Milestones:
1. Iteration #2 of the Plutus PBL Course starts on July 18. Modules 100, 101 and 102 have been DELIVERED on time!
2. Next, we are building the rest of of the Plutus PBL modules, starting with 201: "Three Ways to Mint a Token".

## How to Contribute to PPBL Course:
1. Be a Lead Teacher for a module: review the key links above and the June 28 meeting recording to learn more about what this entails, or ping the group on Discord.
2. Review Content: Everyone is welcome to review [Plutus PBL, Version 1.0](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/courses/15) and the ["Mini-Course" on Gimbal Bounty Treasury + Escrow](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/courses/16). Thank you to Melanie, Sebastian, Stephen W., and Hinson for providing feedback already!
3. Keep learning: Before we can write great educational content, there is plenty we still have to learn. If you're learning about the Cardano-Serialization Libraries, testing upcoming changes with the Vasil hard fork, diving deep into Smart Contract Design Patterns, or thinking about how to teach Haskell, you're preparing to contribute.
4. Write documentation for [Gimbal Bounty Treasury and Escrow](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/gimbal-bounty-treasury-and-escrow).
5. We will discuss these + additional next steps when we meet on 21 June. If you need immediate help or access to contribute in any of the ways listed above, please ping this working group on Discord (#a0-project-based-learning).

# Prior Notes:

### Keep Learning Canvas
- Continue to complete the "Growing With Canvas" Course at [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com). See the note below about Learning Canvas + Current Bounty.

### Learning Canvas + Current Bounty (Updated 2022-05-17)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- One of the Growing with Canvas course assignments is to create a "Sandbox Course". Once you have access to [gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com), you can create a Sandbox Course.
- In order to commit to the Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Cardano mainnet via Nami.

- Create a revenue-generating product from PPBL
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build learning material
- "Report how long A0 Project took and what was achieved.
- Report should be reusable in A1"
