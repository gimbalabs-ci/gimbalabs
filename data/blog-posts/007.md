![Alt text](/blog_007/andamio.jpeg "andamio")

**SIDAN Lab** and **Waffle Capital** have selected the **[Andamio platform](https://www.andamio.io/)**, *powered by Gimbalabs*, as their primary tool for creating and delivering top-tier educational content. This initiative is part of the implementation of the Catalyst Fund 11 funded proposal titled ‚Äú[Gimbalabs | Genius X - Hong Kong Cardano Developer Series](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113090)‚Äù

The series aims **to empower the developer community in Hong Kong** with comprehensive knowledge on the following topics:

- Cardano ecosystem basics
- Cardano technology overview
- Onchain code development (using Aiken)
- Offchain code development (using Mesh)
- Dapp integration & deployment

By leveraging the **Andamio platform**, **SIDAN Lab** and **Waffle Capital** are poised to deliver high-quality educational material, enriching the skill set of developers and fostering growth within the Cardano community in Hong Kong.

> *About **Andamio platform**: based on a Project-Based Learning (PBL) model, Andamio consists of a learning management platform and a contribution management platform that work together to create unique pathways for organizations and contributors to align on meaningful work. It uses the Cardano blockchain to provide individuals with non-custodial ways to create a record of learning and contribution and enables organizations to collaborate on solving important problems.
