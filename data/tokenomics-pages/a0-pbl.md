## What we are doing
- Planning Iteration #2 of Plutus PBL by debriefing Iteration #1 and moving toward a modular, self-paced, project-based model.
- Onboarding to Canvas LMS
- Planning the role that Tokenomics PBL will play in Gimbal Allocation 1, by collecting best ideas/processes/outcomes from Allocation 0 and drafting a modular TPBL Curriculum.

### Next Steps - 2022-05-04
- We will meet every Tuesday at 1830 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)
- Please review the Miro board linked above. At our next meeting on 10 May, we will draft a list of Outcomes and Project Modules for Plutus PBL and Tokenomics PBL. Please review the "raw material" linked at the bottom of the Miro board. If you need access to one of the Gimbalabs Canvas courses, please contact James.
- All Working Group participants are welcome to enroll and complete the [Growing With Canvas Course](https://www.canvas.net/browse/cn-pd/courses/growing-with-canvas). (Note that you're still welcome to participate in this Working Group without completing the course.)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course
at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- In order to commit to a Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Nami.

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Project Based Learning
- Promote GMBL for payment of project dev	Take the raw material of TPBL A0 and PPBL Course #1 and begin to write cohesive PBL Curriculum. Create systems so that other Groups can make rec's for Projects + Case Studies
- Will help when I can.	Create a cleaned-up and tighter curriculum for how to launch a new token.	Find out how to best structure accquried knowledge & materials to create new iterrations of our previous PBL courses.
- Create a revenue-generating product from PPBL
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build learning material
- "Report how long A0 Project took and what was achieved.
- Report should be reusable in A1"
