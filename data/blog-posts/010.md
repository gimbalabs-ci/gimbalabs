Just weeks ahead of the **Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires (Argentina)**, some of the elected community delegates will join the next **Gimbalabs Playground session** to discuss their journey in the collaborative process of ratifying the Cardano Constitution. They’ll share insights into how they carry the responsibility of representing the voices of those who elected them.

This session has been organized for those deeply committed to Cardano governance as a core part of their role within the community. 

Don’t miss this opportunity to connect with your delegates, ask questions, and gain a firsthand look at this pivotal work.

And if you are a delegate, **come and have a sit**.

Date: **November 5th, 2024, 18:00 UTC**
