## Milestone: Deliver the next version of the Plutus PBL Course by July 12.

## How You Can Help:
1. In Canvas, review [Plutus PBL, Version 1.0](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com/courses/15), and provide notes about what needs to be updated/improved over the next 6 weeks. Why this is helpful: it is time-consuming to review material, and those of us who created the first course are often "too close" to it to notice all the ways that it can be improved.
2. In Canvas, review the "GBTE Mini-Course" (linked above). Why this is helpful: same as #1 ;)
3. Write descriptions and/or record videos for the "How to Help with Development" Module in GBTE Mini-Course. Why this is helpful: there's plenty of content to add here. If there's a technical task in this list that interests you, and you'd like help making course-content, please let me know, I'll be thrilled to help you.
4. Write documentation for [Gimbal Bounty Treasury and Escrow](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/gimbal-bounty-treasury-and-escrow). Why this is helpful: We know that not all developers are going to want to work through the Canvas course, and will prefer to simply read the documentation like they're accustomed to doing.
5. Draft ideas and make connections with other projects for Catalyst Fund 9. Why this is helpful: Today's Town Hall made it clear that there's demand for the work we're doing here, and there's a longer list of opportunities than we have time to deliver on. Every time you think big about how we can collaborate with other teams and how we can write a set of proposals to make sure that both PBL and development work get funded, you're giving a developer more time to focus on building!
6. And always, follow your own ideas: if you want to practice building a Module about any topic, go for it! Why this is helpful: we will continue to build Plutus and Tokenomics PBL courses, and to learn together about the PBL framework. Every time you tinker, you're helping to grow our group expertise.
- All of the above should be added to our [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). I'll make sure to add these tasks on Friday (3 June).

### Keep Learning Canvas
- Continue to complete the "Growing With Canvas" Course at [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com). See the note below about Learning Canvas + Current Bounty.

## Next Meeting (2022-06-07 at 1930 UTC)
- This Working Group meets every Tuesday at 1930 UTC, on [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/93346917668?pwd=QnhXSEVLTFlkRGw5czNGMTUvUnFIZz09)

### Learning Canvas + Current Bounty (Updated 2022-05-17)
- Everyone who successfully completes the Growing with Canvas course will earn 25000 gimbals and 75 ada. You can commit to completing the course at the [A0 PBL Working Group Treasury](https://a0pblworkinggroup.gatsbyjs.io/bounties). This instance of the Treasury and Escrow dapp can be used to organize, track, and distribute rewards for contributing to the A0 PBL Working Group. As a group, we can continue to add bounties to the list.
- One of the Growing with Canvas course assignments is to create a "Sandbox Course". Once you have access to [gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com), you can create a Sandbox Course.
- In order to commit to the Bounty, you will need an Access Token to unlock the Treasury. You can [see a list of existing Access Tokens here](https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/68ae22138b3c82c717713d850e5ee57c7de5de8591f5f13cd3a6cc67).
- Need an Access Token? For now, you can get one by messaging James on Discord. You'll need the address of a mainnet wallet that is connected to Cardano mainnet via Nami.

### NOTE: Different Canvas Instances:
1. Most important: [https://gimbalabs.instructure.com](https://gimbalabs.instructure.com): the official Gimbalabs Canvas account. Make sure you can access this one and that you have access to "Growing with Canvas" and that you can create your own "Sandbox Course"
2. First iterations: [https://canvas.instructure.com](https://canvas.instructure.com): this is where we originally tested Plutus PBL and Tokenomics PBL. These course materials will be imported into gimbalabs.instructure.com
3. Optional (only for initial implementation): [https://implementations.instructure.com](https://implementations.instructure.com): For anyone who wants to dive deeper into Canvas Administration. There is a weekly meeting with the Canvas Team on Wednesdays at 1830 UTC. Reach out to James on Discord if you are interested in participating.
