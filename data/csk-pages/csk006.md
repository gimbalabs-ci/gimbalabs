# CSK #006: What can I do with Transaction Metadata on Cardano?

## Outline
1. What is metadata?
2. Metadata on the Cardano blockchain
    - Where is the metadata stored? In transactions! [Learn about UTxO Model](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/adrestia/en/latest/key-concepts/utxo.html)
    - [IOHK Blog Post: Getting to grips with metadata on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/03/getting-to-grips-with-metadata-on-cardano/)
    - [IOHK TxMetadata Documentation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/wiki/TxMetadata)
3. Thinking in JSON
    - `{ "key": "value" }`
    - Distinguishing between arrays `[]` and objects `{}`
    - You can have an array of objects: `[{...}, {...}, {...}]`
    - And an object can be an array: `{ "key": [1, 2, 3] }`
4. We can consume data with [Dandelion](https://gimbalabs.com/dandelionapis)
    - `mainnet` and `testnet`
    - PostgREST and GraphQL
    - Using metadata to conditionally render a front-end
    - What about authentication and security?
5. We can post data with [LIFT Wallet](https://github.com/CodingOnChain/lift-wallet/releases/tag/0.2.0)
    - Release `0.2.0` is hardcoded for experimentation on `testnet`
6. Example: Let's post the responses from CSK 001 as metadata

## Projects
- Use LIFT to post metadata to Cardano Testnet, then build a simple front end to consume and show that data.
- Read [A Journey into Bitcoin Metadata](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330385593_A_Journey_into_Bitcoin_Metadata). Are there any projects that we should tackle on Cardano?


## Next Steps
- In our next CSK, we'll provide the same treatment for tokens, including minting the first two limited edition tokens for Cole and for Juan
- Let's learn as much as we can about metadata and tokens, so that we can be prepared for smart contracts -- we've got a few months to learn! How to get involved.
