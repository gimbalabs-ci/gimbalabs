## What we are doing

### Current Steps
- Planning Iteration #2 of Plutus PBL by debriefing Iteration #1 and moving toward a modular, self-paced, project-based model.
- Onboarding to Canvas LMS (please contact James to be a teacher/admin)
- Planning the role that Tokenomics PBL will play in Gimbal Allocation 1, by collecting best ideas/processes/outcomes from Allocation 0 and drafting a modular TPBL Curriculum.

### Next Steps
- Implement Bounty Treasury and Escrow for PBL Group and for Technical Group
- Establish a meeting cadence and onboard PBL Working Group members

### Big Dreams
- Integrate Canvas API and Cardano protocol.

## A0 Voter Suggested Goals - Project Based Learning
- Promote GMBL for payment of project dev	Take the raw material of TPBL A0 and PPBL Course #1 and begin to write cohesive PBL Curriculum. Create systems so that other Groups can make rec's for Projects + Case Studies
- Will help when I can.	Create a cleaned-up and tighter curriculum for how to launch a new token.	Find out how to best structure accquried knowledge & materials to create new iterrations of our previous PBL courses.
- Create a revenue-generating product from PPBL
- have interesting experiments to share with the group, build learning material
- "Report how long A0 Project took and what was achieved.
- Report should be reusable in A1"
